description = "In this bizarre and unsettling novella, a reclusive taxidermist begins collecting the eyelashes of strangers he meets on the subway, convinced they hold fragments of forgotten dreams. As his collection grows, so does his paranoiaâ€”until the eyelashes start whispering. Part horror, part surreal comedy, The Man Who Collected Eyelashes is a fever-dream exploration of obsession, memory, and the thin line between reality and madness. Perfect for fans of Kafka, Murakami, and that strange dream you had once but never told anyone about."
